Full Binary Tree
	- Each node should have either 0 or 2 nodes
	
Complete Binary Tree
	- Each node should complete the level before moving to next level of the tree
	- Node gets added from left to right
	
Perfect Binary Tree
	- Complete + Full binary tree
	- All the levels should be filled with nodes
	- All the leaves are on the same level
	
Binary Search Tree
	- Left side of the root node should have less value than root
	- Right side of the root node should have greater value than root

Traversing a tree, there are two commonly used technique
	- Breadth First Search or Level Order Traversal
		~ It is a Vertex based algorithm
	- Depth First Search	
		~ It is a edge based algorithm
		* PreOrder Traversal  - NLR
		* InOrder Traversal   - LNR
		* PostOrder Traversal - LRN
